To build this using 3-to-8 decoders (which have 3 inputs and 8 outputs), we first look at the outputs. 32 outputs / 8 outputs per decoder = 4 decoders needed at the output stage. These 4 decoders handle the lower 3 bits of the input. To select which of these 4 decoders is active based on the remaining 2 upper bits, we need a 2-to-4 decoder. Thus, the total is One 2-to-4 decoder (driving the enable pins) and Four 3-to-8 decoders.",

Actually, the standard 2-level AND-OR to NAND-NAND conversion: F = ((AB)' (CD)' E')'. To get (AB)', use 1 NAND. To get (CD)', use 1 NAND. E' requires 1 NAND (inverter). Then combine them: NAND((AB)', (CD)', E'). If 3-input NAND is allowed, total 4. If only 2-input NANDs allowed, the final 3-input NAND must be decomposed, which adds 2 more gates. Total = 6.",
